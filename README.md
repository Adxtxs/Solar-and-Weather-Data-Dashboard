# Solar and Weather Data Dashboard
This dashboard provides an interactive visualization of solar energy production and weather data over time. The dashboard is built using Dash and Plotly.

## Overview
The dashboard includes the following tabs:
1. **Trends**: Line charts showing energy production and average temperature over the years.
2. **Correlation**: A heatmap displaying the correlation matrix between various weather parameters and energy production.
3. **Monthly Energy**: Bar chart showing monthly energy production.
4. **Hourly Patterns**: Line chart showing hourly energy production patterns.
5. **Temperature**: Line chart showing temperature trends over time.
6. **GHI**: Line chart showing Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) trends over time.
7. **Wind Speed**: Histogram showing wind speed distribution.

## Data Analysis Outcomes

### Trends
- **Energy Production**: Observed a fluctuating trend in energy production over the years, with a peak in 2013.
  - **Years Analyzed**: 2005 to 2013.
- **Temperature**: The average temperature has shown a slight increasing trend over the years.
  - **Years Analyzed**: 2005 to 2013.

### Correlation
- **Correlation Matrix**: Identified strong correlations between GHI and energy production, and moderate correlations between temperature and energy production.
  - **Data Points**: Various weather parameters and energy production values from 2005 to 2013.

### Monthly Energy
- **Monthly Energy Production**: Higher energy production observed during summer months, with a peak in July.
  - **Months Analyzed**: January to December (2005 to 2013).

### Hourly Patterns
- **Hourly Energy Production**: Peak energy production occurs around midday, corresponding with maximum sunlight hours.
  - **Hours Analyzed**: 0 to 23 (2005 to 2013).

### Temperature
- **Temperature Trends**: Seasonal temperature variations observed, with higher temperatures during summer months.
  - **Years Analyzed**: 2005 to 2013.

### GHI
- **GHI Trends**: GHI values are highest during summer months, correlating with increased solar energy production.
  - **Years Analyzed**: 2005 to 2013.

### Wind Speed
- **Wind Speed Distribution**: Most common wind speeds are between 2-5 m/s, with occasional higher speeds.
  - **Years Analyzed**: 2005 to 2013.
